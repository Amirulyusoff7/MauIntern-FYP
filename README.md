# Final Year Project - MauIntern

MauIntern is a web platform aimed at making it easier for FTMK students to find internships and connect with companies offering opportunities. The platform addresses the challenges students face when searching for internships, such as limited visibility into opportunities and inefficiencies in the application process.
